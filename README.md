WebScan is a Python script designed to scan a specified website: It retrieves the website's IP address, fetches its location (city and country) using the IP Geolocation API, and then scans the subdomains to identify valid URLs. This script can be useful for website administrators and security professionals to identify potential subdomains and assess the overall security posture of a website.
